# Flutter - Hive - Bored API - Freezed Package - Prototype.

> The goal of the project is to demonstrate how `hive` works with `freezed` flutter package. 

> The project should accept `activity` data from `bored API` and store it in List form. Every time the floating action button is pressed the api will give you a new activity, in a list form.

> The Hive local storage database will store these activites and display even after the app is closed, managing its state.

> In summary, this code sets up a Riverpod provider and a notifier to manage a list of activities. It fetches activities from an API, stores them in a Hive database, and provides methods to retrieve and add activities to the list while updating the state accordingly.
